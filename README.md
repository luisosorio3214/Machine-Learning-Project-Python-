# Machine-Learning-Project-Python-
A composition of Machine Learning Projects in python using algorithms in supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning including some Time Series analysis.   

This repository contains a list of projects where each contions a python jupyter notebook implememnting serveral machine learning algorithms. All these notebooks were created by me and contains notes/references that I usually come back to. While I was a student at Cal State Long Beach I became fascinated into machine learning and writing python code that I ended up creating all these projects. This is how I started my journey into Data Science and still find many use cases for these projects. Many of the models are practically ready for app deployment and need further coding from externel users or for my future projects. Feel free to explore my notebooks and I hope you learn some valuable steps into the machine learning process. I spent many hours building these notebooks and hope it will help someone out.
