# Machine-Learning-Project-Python-
A composition of Machine Learning Projects in python using algorithms in supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning.  

The projects in this repository is a mixture of projects done in my Masters Mathematics program at California State University of Long Beach and independent study outside of class. Feel free to take any code and make it your own.
